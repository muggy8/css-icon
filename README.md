# css-icon
A small set of of CSS based icons that uses fontsize to scale that aims to:

- tween between different icons beautifully
- avoid using `position: absolute` so they dont hover over other things randomly
- contain each icon into a square
- auto icons relative to the font size.
- color the icons based off the current color CSS attribute.

Many of these goals just needs a few modifications for implementation changes but overall I think it's a fun project to work on so hope you enjoy.
